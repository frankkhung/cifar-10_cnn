- CIFAR-10 is a image data set that contains planes, cars, birds, cats, deers, dogs, frogs, boats, and trucks. 
- Comparing to MNIST dataset, there are more colors and more noises. Thus, the difficulties for identifying CIFAR-10 images are high. 
- Here we use 30 epoches to reach 96.42% accuracy. 
- The most mis-classified animals are cats and dogs, we can see tha from the confuse matrix that we created in the file
